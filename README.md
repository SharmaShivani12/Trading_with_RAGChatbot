✅ Live Market Data (via CoinGecko API)

Get the latest price of supported coins (BTC, ETH, ADA, LTC, XRP, DOT, DOGE, SOL).

View 7-day price trend charts for quick technical insight.

Rule-based Buy/Sell signals (based on 7-day percentage change).

✅ RAG-Powered Q&A (LangChain + Local LLM)

Ask general crypto questions (e.g., “What is Bitcoin halving?”, “Explain Proof of Stake”).

Get educational explanations from indexed documents.

Handle contextual queries that don’t require real-time data.

⚙️ How It Works

🔹 Queries using API (Live Data):

"BTC price", "ETH price now", "Live ADA price" → fetches real-time price.

"BTC trend", "Show ETH trend" → plots 7-day trend chart.

"Should I buy BTC?", "ETH sell?" → uses 7-day % change to suggest BUY / SELL / HOLD.

🔹 Queries using RAG (Context + Docs):

"What is Bitcoin?"

"How does Ethereum staking work?"

"Explain blockchain consensus mechanisms."

"Risks of investing in crypto?"

Python 3.9+

If the query is about definitions, concepts, risks, or general knowledge → it’s answered with RAG.
If the query is about prices, trends, buy/sell signals → it’s answered with API + charts.
